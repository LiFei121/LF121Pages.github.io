My current research interests are Graph Computing Systems，Graph Neural Network System.

I’m currently a 4th year student of Artificial Intelligence at [Nanchang University](https://www.ncu.edu.cn/). I have been admitted to pursue my Master degree at School of Artifical Intelligence, [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://zh.bit.edu.cn/) without entrance examination. I used to do Natural Language Processing research, now I mainly focus on Graph Computing Systems, Graph Neural Network Systems.
