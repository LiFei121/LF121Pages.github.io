My current research interests are recommender systems, fairness, and time series.

I am currently a Ph.D student in Computer Science and Engineering at HKUST since the fall of 2023 under the supervision of Prof. Raymond Wong.

I received my Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications(BUPT), and my final year project “Research on Fairness of Top-k Based on Interactive Search” won the Outstanding Undergraduate Graduation Design (Thesis) of Beijing Ordinary Colleges and Universities under the supervision of Prof. Jingyu Wang.

I have worked on mobile computer systems under the supervision of Prof. Mengwei Xu, BUPT and Dr. Ting Cao, Microsoft Research Asia.

I have worked on dynamic graph algorithms as a visiting student at the University of British Columbia under the supervision of Prof. Matei Ripeanu, which was supported by Mitacs globalink research internship and China Scholarship Council.
